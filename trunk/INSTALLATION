because we can use phpBB2's user authentication.  At this time FishCMS
REQUIRES phpBB2!!!

PHP4
Apache 1.3.x or 2.0.x
phpBB 2.0.x (LATEST VERSION IS HIGHLY RECOMENDED)

!!!INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS!!!
so here's how you install FishCMS.
Step 1: download and install the latest release of phpBB2.
   NOTE: you can install phpBB2 on a subdomain, but we recomend using a
         subdirectory such as /forums/ if you plan to follow step 2.
Step 2: download, install, and configure Coppermine Photo gallery (optional).
Step 3: download and install FishCMS.
Step 4: edit the phpbbauth.php file in your FishCMS directory.
