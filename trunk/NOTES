Note from project leader.
In this file you will find my mindless ramblings, thoughts, ect.
What you find in here may be usefull, may be pointless, but can not be taken
to mean that whats in here will happen officially.




Project: FishCMS
Goal: simple, easy to deploy, easy to use CMS with features for christian websites.

Planned Features:
Easy intergration with phpBB 2.0   (phpBB2 will be a dependancy until atleast V0.3.0).
Simple template engine (templates can be created from a single html page);

Categories.
With FishCMS you will create categories once, and then they will be
available accross the entire site.  You will not have to create a category
for news then create it again for links, and once again for articles.

planned files to do:
   admin/custom.php	will allow the admin to create blocks, custom php, and html files ( targeted for V0.3.0).
